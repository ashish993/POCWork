## INCIDENT SUMMARY & ANALYSIS

### Scenario
A comprehensive cybersecurity incident drill was conducted by the company, a SaaS-based organization hosted on AWS, to test resilience against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and Web Application Firewall (WAF) evasion attempts. The drill simulated real-world attack scenarios targeting both network and application layers, including a flood of ICMP packets and attempts to bypass WAF protections. The objective was to validate the effectiveness of AWS-native security controls, incident response processes, and communication protocols.

### Employees Engaged in the Drill
- **John Smith** – Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)
- **Priya Patel** – Security Operations Lead
- **Alex Chen** – Cloud Infrastructure Engineer
- **Maria Garcia** – Application Security Specialist
- **David Lee** – Incident Response Analyst
- **Sophie Dubois** – Communications Manager
- **Ravi Kumar** – DevOps Engineer
- **Emma Johnson** – Compliance Officer

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Analysis
| Phase    | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Identify** | Regular audits and threat modeling identified potential DDoS and WAF evasion risks. AWS Security Hub and GuardDuty were used for continuous risk assessment. |
| **Protect**  | AWS WAF rules, rate limiting, and Shield Advanced were configured. IAM policies and security groups were reviewed. Staff received targeted security training. |
| **Detect**   | AWS CloudWatch, GuardDuty, and custom monitoring detected abnormal traffic and WAF bypass attempts. Alerts were configured for rapid escalation. |
| **Respond**  | The incident response team blocked malicious IPs, updated WAF rules, and scaled resources using AWS Auto Scaling. Internal and external communications were managed per the incident response plan. |
| **Recover**  | All services were restored to normal operation. A post-mortem was conducted, lessons learned were documented, and improvements were implemented. |

### Drill Timeline
- **Preparation:** Drill planning, scenario development, AWS environment setup, and stakeholder alignment (June 10, 2025)
- **Attack Simulation:** DDoS and WAF evasion attacks launched (June 12, 2025, 10:00–12:00 UTC)
- **Detection & Response:** Security team detected and responded to attacks in real time
- **Recovery:** Systems restored, communications sent, and post-drill review held (June 12, 2025, 12:00–14:00 UTC)

### Communication & Notification
- **Internal:** All IT, Security, DevOps, and Executive teams were notified via Slack and email. Regular updates were provided during the drill. A debrief session was held post-drill.
- **External:** No customer impact occurred. Prepared communication templates for customers and partners were reviewed. Compliance and legal teams were informed.

### Outcomes & Improvements
- AWS WAF and Shield Advanced effectively mitigated simulated attacks.
- Detection and response times met or exceeded SLAs.
- Identified need for additional WAF rule tuning and more frequent incident response training.
- Updated incident response playbooks and improved cross-team communication protocols.
- Recommendations for regular penetration testing and continuous improvement of AWS security posture.

## RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS

The risk management process follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and includes:
- Regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security.
- Implementation of policies, procedures, training, and technical controls to mitigate cybersecurity threats (e.g., firewall rules, IDS/IPS, network monitoring).
- Continuous monitoring to detect abnormal traffic patterns and unauthorized access attempts.
- Incident response procedures to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, with updates to playbooks and staff training.
- Recovery plans to restore affected systems, data, and operations, including regular backups and consideration of cyber insurance.
- Post-incident reviews and lessons learned sessions to drive continuous improvement.
